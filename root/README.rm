Files in this directory ("root") MUST be copied to the root of the
server (where the folder "Go-Everywhere" exists). This is extremely
important, and the website will not function otherwise (unless specific
code changes it). You will also need to read the comments in each file,
for specific setup. In most cases, the scripts have default setup, and
will work with minimal setup required.
